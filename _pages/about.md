What do I do?

I focus on solving challenging problems relevant to geothermal energy and national security using geophysical methods and tools. Seismic data acquisition and monitoring approaches are approaching a tipping point with the advent of Distributed Acoustic / Strain Sensing (DAS or DSS) technology. I'm seeking to advance this technology and its use cases to constrain dynamics of subsurface fluid flow, fracture mechanics and changes in stress and phase. 

Tools & Techniques:



What Kinds of Problems?

Geothermal Systemts:

Geologic Carbon Storage:

Fractures in the Subsurface:

Near Surface Processes in the Cryosphere:

Seismic Monitoring of Shallow and Deep Hydrology:

Other Problems:
